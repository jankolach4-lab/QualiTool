The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining and expanding the existing QualiTool (a legacy React application running within an iframe in a Next.js dashboard) and the Admin Dashboard. The core challenge initially was fixing the QualiTool's automatic Supabase synchronization, which was plagued by JavaScript syntax errors, script execution order issues, and incorrect variable scoping. This involved extensive debugging and iterative fixes within  of the QualiTool.

Following the successful resolution of the auto-sync, the work shifted to UI/UX improvements for the QualiTool. This included redesigning the address list layout, implementing a street filter with odd/even house number sorting, and refining status prioritization logic. Further iterations focused on column width adjustments, integrating a Zusatz field into the address line, and removing unnecessary debug/sync buttons from the sidebar. A significant recurring issue was the persistence of the street filter after app restarts in the Android APK, leading to multiple attempts at fixing scope and caching.

Towards the end, the engineer began work on the Admin Dashboard to sort projects alphabetically, which also faced persistence issues. Finally, the user requested combining the Aktivitätenkalender and Statusübersicht into a new Dashboard section within the QualiTool sidebar, leading to the creation of a backup and the initial removal of old sidebar buttons. The trajectory highlights the iterative nature of development, the need for robust debugging, and careful management of UI and data consistency in a mixed-technology codebase.

The Qualifizierungstool admin dashboard provides real-time analytics for projects and VPs, featuring an overall view of total projects, VPs, and residential units. It includes a project table with details (city, WE, VP count, completions, status percentage, progress bar) and a map button to open a project-specific completion map. Project Analytics offers charts for daily completions, status changes, and breakdowns. A Project Projection Tool forecasts completions based on start/end dates, manual total WE, and federal state. VP Analytics provides similar charts, including hourly activity. The Polygontool, linked from the dashboard, is for geocoding and polygon management. A new Completion Map feature displays abschluss (green) and online/ts-abschluss (blue) markers with accurate house numbers and VP names. The critical QualiTool (legacy app) needs stable Supabase synchronization, a functional sidebar on web/Android APK, and Excel Export for general contacts. Recent additions include:
- A new layout for the address list in QualiTool: PLZ/Ort (smaller font) above Straße/Nr. (bold, smaller font), with more space for WE, Name, Status.
- A street filter in QualiTool to sort by even/odd house numbers.
- A special status priority rule for Kein Eintritt persönlich and Kein Interesse based on recency.
- CSV Export for WE-Korrekturen in QualiTool.
- Alphabetical sorting for the project list in the Admin Dashboard.
- A new Dashboard section in QualiTool combining Statistik anzeigen and Aktivitätenkalender.

**Key files and changes:**

-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: The core legacy QualiTool application.
    *   **Changes**: Extensive work on Supabase auto-synchronization (fixing syntax errors, script loading order, consolidating  calls, ensuring session loading, implementing  and  with ). UI/UX improvements:
        *   Address list layout: PLZ/Ort (smaller) on top, Straße/Nr. (bold, smaller) below.
        *   Column widths adjusted for Adresse, WE, Name, Status, Datum.
        *   Added new dropdown for Street filter with Alle Hausnummern, Nur gerade Hausnummern, Nur ungerade Hausnummern options.
        *   Status prioritization logic modified for Kein Eintritt persönlich and Kein Interesse to prioritize by recency if newer.
        *   WE-Korrekturen Export changed from XLSX to CSV.
        *   Removed Debug-Panel and Synchronize buttons from the sidebar.
        *   Filter persistence for Street filter after data changes.
        *   Attempted various fixes for Street filter not persisting after APK restart (scope fixes, setTimeout, localStorage caching, all reverted due to breaking other functionality or not working).
        *   Creation of a new Dashboard section, removal of old Statistik anzeigen and Aktivitätenkalender sidebar buttons.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Login page for QualiTool.
    *   **Changes**:  and  implemented to ensure user data row exists in Supabase upon login, critical for auto-sync.
-   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Admin Dashboard displaying project analytics.
    *   **Changes**: Implemented alphabetical sorting for the projects list within the  function.
-   ** (CREATED)**:
    *   **Importance**: Backup of the QualiTool's main page before major dashboard structure changes.

<pending_tasks>
-   **QualiTool WE-Korrekturen Sync**: Deferred to later.
-   **Admin User Management**: Admin whitelist RLS setup and optional client-side checks for  table.
-   **Projection Tool Enhancements**: Optional UI hints, Bundesland selection persistence in Supabase, alternative rate models, small badge with forecast on project card.
-   **Polygontool Enhancements**: Further geocoding improvements or integration of a second geocoding provider. Standard behavior for points exactly on the polygon boundary.
-   **QualiTool Straßenfilter persistence (APK)**: The street filter still disappears after app restart in the APK; this remains an unresolved, acknowledged problem.
-   **Implement combined Dashboard view in QualiTool**: The implementation has just started by removing old sidebar buttons.
-   **Fix Dashboard alphabetical sorting**: The dashboard's project list sorting is still not working despite code changes, possibly due to caching or other JS errors.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on integrating the Aktivitätenkalender and Statusübersicht into a new Dashboard section within the QualiTool sidebar. The user explicitly requested to combine these two existing sections into a single new view, accessible via a new sidebar button, and to remove the old individual buttons. The user also specified that the app should continue to start with the contact list as the default view.

The AI engineer successfully created a backup of  at  to ensure a rollback point. Following this, the first step of the plan was executed: removing the old Statistik anzeigen and Aktivitätenkalender buttons from the sidebar. The AI engineer is currently in the process of identifying the content of the  and  sections within  to move them into the new dashboard section.
