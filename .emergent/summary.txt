The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows an extensive, iterative debugging process for a Capacitor-based Android app (Qualifizierungstool) integrated with Supabase. The primary objective was reliable data synchronization for contacts and status events. Initial work involved SQL function fixes, RLS policies, and client-side queuing. The core problem, missing events from Tablet 1, persisted despite numerous patches.

Debugging focused on two main areas: client-side logic (ensuring status changes are captured, persisted locally, and sent via RPCs) and server-side Supabase functions/RLS (ensuring correct processing and storage). Key issues identified included incorrect RPC parameter usage on the client, UI elements not reacting, and  errors, often stemming from script execution order/scope within the WebView and outdated APK builds. The AI engineer introduced a visible debug panel for better diagnostics. The most recent interaction involves the user providing the full  for review and requesting the final corrected file for copy-pasting, following persistent issues.

The project involves transforming a web-based Qualifizierungstool into an Android APK using Capacitor, complemented by an Admin Dashboard. Key functionalities include native Android features (e.g., Excel export), multi-user authentication with Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS), and robust offline capabilities for the tablet app. The Admin Dashboard requires project/employee analytics with custom branding and project-isolated data views. Critical to both is reliable data synchronization from the Qualifizierungstool to Supabase for contact updates and status changes, with integrated offline handling. Export (PNG, CSV, PDF) and advanced filtering were also required. Development has progressed with Android APK conversion, partial Supabase user management (tables , , , ), and ongoing Admin Dashboard work. Excel import/export was a focus. Client-side offline queuing and Supabase RPCs were implemented but faced significant challenges with database functions, RLS, unique constraints, and client-side script execution/data persistence.

- **Frontend**: HTML (Vanilla JS, CSS), Capacitor (for Android APK), XLSX.js (Excel), localStorage (offline queueing).
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS, PL/pgSQL functions/RPCs, triggers, ).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (Android APK builds).
- **SQL Concepts**: , , .

- :
    - **Importance**: Main client-side logic for the Qualifizierungstool, including UI rendering, data input, local storage, Supabase integration, and sync mechanisms.
    - **Changes Made**: Iterative changes were applied to:
        - Implement initial auto-sync via , , , .
        - Refine Supabase client initialization () and error logging ().
        - Implement a  and .
        - Add a debug overlay (initially hidden, later a visible sidebar icon leading to ) to diagnose sync issues.
        - Corrected RPC calls in  to use  and  parameters.
        - Explicitly bind event listeners to buttons (e.g., , ) to avoid delegation issues.
        - Ensure  is globally accessible via .
        - Add buttons Lokale Kontakte leeren () and Leeren + Sync () for local data management.
        - Integrate a build tag () and a status line (, ) into the debug panel for better visibility of script execution and app version.
        - Cleaned up script blocks, removing superfluous  and ensuring correct Supabase global defaults.
- :
    - **Importance**: Handles user authentication with Supabase.
    - **Changes Made**: Initialized  to ensure a consistent Supabase client across the app.
- Supabase SQL Functions/Triggers:
    - **Importance**: Server-side logic for data persistence and event generation.
    - **Changes Made**: Extensive refinement for , , and triggers like . This included fixing SQL syntax (dollar-quoting,  prefixes), RLS issues (,  user IDs), unique constraint violations (), and ensuring  for RPCs.
- Supabase Tables (, , , ):
    - **Importance**: Core data storage.
    - **Changes Made**: RLS policies were adjusted, unique indexes (especially on ) refined, and general indexing for performance.

<pending_tasks>
- **Client-side Status Persistence Patch**: The final  with corrected RPC parameters, explicit button bindings, build tag, and local clear/sync functionality needs to be deployed and verified on Tablet 1.
- **Dashboard Tile Values**: Correct the values displayed in the Admin Dashboard tiles.
- **Project List Filtering**: Implement functionality to filter the project list to show only active projects.
- **PDF Export Button**: Make the PDF export button in the Admin Dashboard visible and functional.
- **Excel Export Fix**: (Optional, user deferred) Fix the broken Excel export functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving persistent client-side data synchronization issues on Tablet 1, specifically the manualDirectSyncNow is not defined error and the  mismatch between the local app's perceived state (empty) and the debug panel/Supabase (showing 383 old contacts).

The AI engineer's most recent actions were:
1.  **Server-side Cleanup**: Suggested the user run SQL queries to explicitly empty the  table in Supabase for the affected user, to align server state with the desired empty client state. (User reported 0 rows affected).
2.  **Client-side Code Refinement**: Analyzed the user-provided  to diagnose the  error. Identified root causes as:
    *   An extraneous  at the end of a script block.
    *   Incorrect function scope, preventing  from being globally accessible.
    *   Potential issues with event delegation for button clicks.
3.  **Comprehensive  Provision**: Created and provided a complete, corrected  to the user, intended for direct copy-pasting. This version includes:
    *   Explicit global definition for  and .
    *    explicitly defined as a global asynchronous function, containing the corrected RPC calls ( with ,  with  and ), along with table upsert as a fallback.
    *   Explicit event listener bindings for all debug panel buttons (, , , , , , ) to ensure reliable click handling.
    *   Added Lokale Kontakte leeren () and Leeren + Sync () buttons to the visible debug panel to manage local  contacts and synchronize the empty state to Supabase.
    *   Integrated a visible build tag () and a live status line () within the debug panel to trace execution flow and verify the deployed code version.
    *   Removed the problematic  and cleaned up script block structure.
4.  **User Feedback**: The user complained about the formatting of the provided , requesting it in a grauen Block (grey block) and less Durcheinander (mess). The agent process is currently paused, awaiting a response to this formatting request.
