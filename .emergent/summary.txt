The AI engineer's work involved a challenging transition from a static HTML dashboard to a Next.js application, complicated by persistent issues with Git synchronization and Vercel deployment. Initially, the AI debugged an existing static HTML dashboard, then pivoted to a full Next.js rebuild upon user clarification regarding the desired technology and deployment platform. This migration phase was heavily impacted by the AI's inability to reliably push changes to GitHub from the container, necessitating frequent manual user intervention for file creation and Git operations.

Once a basic Next.js structure was deployed, the core challenge shifted to data integration and display. Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase was identified as the reason for incomplete data retrieval, which was resolved by creating specific read-only policies. Subsequently, the AI focused on implementing detailed analytics features, clarifying data structures for time-series and status-based analyses, and initiating the development of React components for charts and detailed tables.

The goal is to maintain a Qualifizierungstool (Android app) and build a robust Admin Dashboard providing real-time analytics. The dashboard must feature:
- **Overall View:** Total projects, VPs, and residential units (WE).
- **Project Table:** Tabular data for Project (City), WE, VP count, direct completions, status percentage, and progress bar, with clickable rows for drill-down.
- **Project Analytics:** Charts for daily completions, daily status changes, status breakdown (pie chart), status table, and a project projection tool with holiday detection.
- **VP Table:** Lists VPs within a selected project, showing name, WE, completions, and completion percentages, with clickable rows.
- **VP Analytics:** Charts for daily completions, daily status changes, status breakdown (pie chart), status table, hourly activity, and a summary table.
- **Time Range:** Selectable periods (7, 14, 30, 90, 120 days) for bar charts.
- **Data Source:** Primarily  JSONB field in Supabase, supplemented by  for VP names.
- **Design:** Simple, professional, comprehensive with Admin Dashboard Pro title.
- **Authentication:** Functional login via  (now ).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript), HTML, CSS (inline styling and ).
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Row Level Security).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with  data type (),  table.
- **Charting Library:** Chart.js, .
- **Date Manipulation:** .
- **Deployment:** Vercel.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main dashboard page, serving as the entry point for the core analytics display.
    -   **Changes Made**: Has undergone significant evolution. Initially contained mock data, then refactored to fetch and process  and  data. Currently being extended to integrate  and  components, processing status history for time-based charts and current status for breakdowns. It contains the primary data fetching and processing logic.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the overall HTML structure and includes global CSS and external libraries like Font Awesome.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include Font Awesome CSS.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS styling for the Next.js application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains styling for a professional, responsive dashboard.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Dedicated login and registration page for user authentication with Supabase.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created as part of the Next.js migration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Initializes the Supabase client and defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated with interfaces for , , , , and aggregated data types (, ) to support analytics requirements. Fallback values were added for Supabase environment variables.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Component responsible for rendering project-specific analytical charts and tables.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to house charts for daily completions, daily status changes, and status breakdown.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays a table of VPs associated with a selected project.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and integrated into the Next.js structure.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Configuration for Next.js and TypeScript.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was modified to ignore the old  directory to prevent compilation errors from the legacy React app.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Vercel deployment configuration, including rewrites.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to correct root route redirection to the login page.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement Excel Export**: This functionality was requested and existed in the old dashboard.
-   **Fix WE-Korrekturen Sync**: The issue of WE-Korrekturen (unit corrections) not saving to Supabase.
-   **Complete Project Analytics**: Implement full charting (daily completions, status changes, status breakdown, status table) based on processed data.
-   **Implement VP Analytics**: Create charts (daily completions, status changes, status breakdown, hourly activity, summary table) and populate them.
-   **Implement Project Projection Tool**: Develop start/end date input with holiday detection for completion rate forecasting.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into implementing the detailed analytics features requested by the user. The primary focus was on extending the data processing logic within  to correctly derive the necessary metrics for project and VP analytics from the  and  Supabase tables, particularly utilizing the  for time-series data and the  field for current breakdowns.

The AI clarified the data logic with the user:
1.  **Current Status (for Status-Breakdown):** Use the  field directly for pie charts and tables.
2.  **StatusHistory (for Time-Based Analytics):** Parse  entries to count daily completions (status abschluss), daily status changes, and hourly VP activity using the Sat Oct  4 16:09:15 UTC 2025 field.

The engineer then implemented the extended data processing and updated the TypeScript interfaces in  to accommodate new aggregated data fields (e.g., , , ).

Following this, the AI began implementing the Chart.js components. Specifically, it created  (to display project-specific charts) and was in the process of creating/integrating  and likely  to display individual VP details and their respective charts. The last action was: Jetzt integriere ich die ProjectAnalytics in die Hauptseite und erstelle die VP-Analytics. indicating the shift from data processing to UI component integration for analytics.
