The trajectory details a complex, multi-phase debugging and rebuilding effort for a Capacitor/Supabase application's Admin Dashboard. Initially, the AI engineer struggled with UI rendering issues (Invalid Date, empty KPI tiles) and RPC call failures (404s,  data) due to incorrect function signatures and a misunderstanding of the underlying data sources ( vs. ). A significant hurdle was the confusion regarding the application's deployment environment and which  file represented the actual dashboard. After multiple failed attempts at incremental fixes and a user-initiated rollback, the strategy shifted dramatically. The user explicitly requested a complete rebuild of the dashboard, drawing all data directly from the  JSONB structure and incorporating extensive new functional and design specifications. The AI successfully delivered a comprehensive, new HTML file () designed to fulfill these requirements, including advanced analytics, project projection, and automated holiday detection. A final critical step involved correcting an incorrect Supabase API key in the newly generated code.

The overall goal is to maintain a Qualifizierungstool (Capacitor Android app for field agents with Supabase backend) and an associated web-based Admin Dashboard for analytics. The dashboard must offer accurate, real-time data on user and project performance, supporting drill-down functionality.

Key requirements for the rebuilt dashboard, as detailed by the user in the latter part of the trajectory, are:
-   **Overall View:** A tabular row displaying total projects, total VPs (Vertriebspartner - sales partners), and total WE (Wohn-Einheiten - residential units).
-   **Project Table:** A table with columns for Project (City), WE count, VP count, direct completions, and a status percentage (completions/total WE). Rows should be clickable to highlight and populate project-specific sections.
-   **Project Tiles/Charts (after selection):**
    1.  Daily completions for all VPs (bar chart).
    2.  Daily status changes for all VPs (bar chart).
    3.  Status breakdown as a pie chart with a legend.
    4.  Status table showing absolute counts and percentages relative to total project WE.
    5.  Project duration input (start/end dates) with a projection for future WE completions, considering 5 workdays/week and automatic holiday detection.
-   **VP Table (under project selection):** A table listing VPs within the selected project, showing VP name, their WE count, their completions, completion percentage relative to their own WE, and relative to the total project WE. Rows should be clickable to highlight and populate VP-specific sections.
-   **VP Tiles/Charts (after selection):**
    1.  Daily direct completions for the VP (bar chart).
    2.  Daily status changes for the VP (bar chart).
    3.  Status breakdown as a pie chart with a legend.
    4.  Status table showing absolute counts and percentages relative to the VP's WE.
    5.  Hourly activity chart for a selectable day, showing status changes by hour.
    6.  Summary table: Total status changes, total direct completions, change/completion ratio, WE with status (absolute and percentage), and total WE.
-   **Time Range Selection:** All bar charts should allow selection of 7, 14, 30, 90, and 120 days.
-   **Data Source:** All dashboard data must be derived directly from the  JSONB structure, as  proved unreliable.
-   **Design:** Simple, professional, no loss of information.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a single-page application (SPA).
-   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase (PostgreSQL, RPC/PL/pgSQL functions).
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL with  data type for  table (storing nested contact/resident data).
-   **Charting Library:** Chart.js, with .
-   **Date Manipulation:**  for robust date handling.
-   **Deployment:** Vercel (for static HTML/React projects, initially confused with Next.js).

<code_architecture>


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The Capacitor Android application's single HTML entry point.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily debugged and reverted to a stable version from  due to AI-introduced regressions. Not the focus of the recent dashboard work.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The initial Admin Dashboard's HTML file.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced entirely from . Subject to numerous JavaScript edits to fix RPC calls, date formatting, and KPI calculations, which ultimately proved insufficient due to data source issues and repository confusion.

-   ** (e.g., , )**
    -   **Importance**: Define Supabase tables and PL/pgSQL RPC functions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Many functions were rewritten to query  JSONB data instead of  tables.  was created to standardize date formats. However, many RPCs remained problematic or inaccessible, leading to the decision to abandon RPCs for dashboard data.

-   ** and **
    -   **Importance**: These files were created when the AI mistakenly assumed a React/Next.js setup for the dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was created as a React component, and  was modified to include its routes. These changes were discarded once the user clarified the dashboard was a static HTML page.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the most critical new file. It represents the entirely rebuilt Admin Dashboard, incorporating all detailed user requirements, directly consuming data from  JSONB, and intended to be deployed as the main  for the dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was newly created, containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic to fulfill the comprehensive requirements, including interactive tables, charts, and a project projection module, and updated with the correct Supabase API key.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix WE-Korrekturen Sync**: The issue of WE-Korrekturen (unit corrections) not saving to Supabase was investigated but put on hold early in the process and not revisited.
-   **Implement Excel Export**: This functionality was requested initially and is present in the old  (e.g.,  button) but not explicitly integrated into the new dashboard's requirements or implemented as a full feature.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the extensive task of rebuilding the Admin Dashboard from scratch. This was necessitated by persistent issues with the previous dashboard, including empty KPI tiles, Invalid Date errors in charts, and fundamentally, RPC functions failing to return data from the  table. The user provided a highly detailed set of requirements for this new dashboard, emphasizing data extraction directly from the  JSONB field.

The AI delivered a complete, new HTML file named . This file contains all the necessary HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic to:
1.  Load and process all  data from Supabase.
2.  Populate a global overview of projects, VPs, and total WE.
3.  Render interactive project and VP tables.
4.  Display various project-specific and VP-specific KPIs and charts (daily completions, daily changes, status breakdowns, hourly activity).
5.  Implement a project projection module that calculates estimated completions based on historical data, project timelines, and automatic detection of German holidays.
6.  Ensure robust date formatting to prevent Invalid Date errors.
7.  Include debug functions (, ).

A critical last-minute fix involved correcting the  in the new dashboard's JavaScript, as the AI had inadvertently used an outdated or incorrect key, causing an Invalid API key error upon initial testing. This correction was successfully made and incorporated into the final provided code. The user's most recent action was requesting the complete, copy-ready code, which the AI provided.

<optional_next_step>
The user needs to copy the provided code into their  in the  repository on GitHub and deploy it via Vercel.
