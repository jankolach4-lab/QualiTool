The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing the Qualifizierungstool (tablet app) and its integration with Supabase, while concurrently resolving numerous database and frontend issues for an Admin Dashboard. The initial tasks involved fixing complex SQL functions for dashboard analytics, handling  and  errors, and addressing Vercel deployment issues.

A major iterative effort was dedicated to establishing reliable data synchronization for user contacts and status events from the tablet app to Supabase. This involved developing and repeatedly refining Supabase RPCs (, ), ensuring correct RLS policies, and implementing client-side queuing mechanisms. Persistent SQL syntax errors, particularly around dollar-quoting and ambiguous function overloads, required multiple iterations of dropping and recreating functions.

The most recent phase concentrated on resolving the missing events issue from the new app version (Tablet 1). This led to a deep dive into Supabase's behavior with  in the SQL editor,  properties, and conflicting unique indexes (). The core problem was identified as a client-side failure to reliably persist status changes in the  snapshot and/or send RPCs, compounded by an incorrect unique key definition that hampered server-side backfill attempts. The AI proposed and implemented various server-side patches (logging, internal functions, trigger, backfill logic using ) and client-side patches (robust event flush, status-diff detector, generic click-hook). The current state is that client-side status persistence remains an issue, and the user has explicitly requested a final app-side patch to resolve this.

The project aims to transform a web-based Qualifizierungstool into a Capacitor-based Android APK and create a corresponding Admin Dashboard. Core requirements included native Android functionalities (e.g., Excel export), multi-user authentication with Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS) and offline capabilities for the tablet app. A key objective was the Admin Dashboard, which needed to display project and employee analytics (KPIs, charts, tables) with custom branding, ensuring robust data consistency and project-isolated views. Data synchronization from the Qualifizierungstool to Supabase was crucial for status changes and contact list updates, with offline handling. The system needed export capabilities (PNG, CSV, PDF), advanced filtering, and performance optimizations. So far, the Android APK conversion is progressing, user management is partially implemented through Supabase (with , , ,  tables), and the Admin Dashboard is under development. Excel import/export functionality was a primary focus. Client-side logic for offline queuing and data synchronization to Supabase via RPCs was implemented, but encountered significant database-side challenges with function definitions, RLS, and unique constraints.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into diagnosing and resolving why status changes from Tablet 1 (running the new app version) were not appearing in Supabase's  table, despite numerous server-side and client-side patches.

The AI engineer has established the following:
1.  **Server-side Robustness**: Supabase functions (, , , ) and a trigger () are now correctly defined and configured. The internal function includes logging to a  table for traceability. It correctly handles upserting contacts and residents, and generating events based on status changes (now also considering  from the  snapshot). Unique indexes on  have been corrected to .
2.  **Client-side Sync Mechanisms (Existing)**: The app has a comprehensive JavaScript patch that initializes the Supabase client, uses offline queuing (), includes heuristics for local contact data, and attempts to call  for contacts and  for status changes. Robust fallbacks (e.g., ), retry logic, and error persistence () are in place. A  and  were added to capture changes more reliably.
3.  **Current Problem**: Despite server-side logic working and client-side detection mechanisms, new events from Tablet 1 are not reaching the database. Debugging revealed that either RPC calls are not being sent from the client, or more critically, the status changes made in the app are *not reliably persisting into the  (or ) fields within the local  snapshot* before synchronization attempts. This means the server-side trigger, which relies on the  snapshot, cannot detect changes, and the direct RPC calls are also not firing.

The user has explicitly chosen Option A: implementing a minimal app-side patch to ensure status changes are reliably persisted in the local snapshot and then triggering the server-side snapshot processing.
