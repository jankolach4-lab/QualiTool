The previous AI engineer's work involved an extensive, multi-phase effort to evolve a web tool into an Android APK and build a standalone Admin Dashboard. The initial focus was on resolving numerous SQL-related bugs within the Supabase database, primarily around function definitions, column name mismatches ( vs ), data type inconsistencies, and join logic in analytics functions. This iterative debugging process for the dashboard's data presentation was a significant part of the early interactions.

Following the stabilization of the dashboard's data, the work shifted to implementing requested UI/UX enhancements and deployment to a custom domain () via Vercel and GitHub. This phase introduced new challenges, including Vercel deployment specifics (e.g., the  folder for static assets) and further UI component integration.

Subsequently, critical Supabase security issues (RLS, function search paths, OTP expiry) were addressed, which temporarily broke the dashboard due to stricter access controls. This led to refining the admin whitelist and ensuring user permissions. Most recently, a major data synchronization bug was tackled: status changes from the tablet-based Qualifizierungstool were not reaching Supabase. The proposed fix involved adding client-side JavaScript logic to the Qualifizierungstool to  and handle offline queuing, ensuring data consistency across the ecosystem. The very last message indicates a build workflow error after these Qualifizierungstool changes.

<product_requirements>
The overall project goal was to transform a static web tool into a Capacitor-based Android APK and build a separate Admin Dashboard. Key requirements included:
1.  **APK Conversion**: Packaging the static HTML/CSS/JS web tool into an Android APK, ensuring existing functions (e.g., Excel import/export) work natively.
2.  **User Management**: Implementing multi-user login with Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS) for data isolation, with offline capabilities for the Qualifizierungstool.
3.  **UI/UX Fixes**: Addressing bugs like Excel import/export, sidebar navigation, and native file export in the Qualifizierungstool, and modernizing its appearance.
4.  **Admin Dashboard**: Developing a *standalone* dashboard for Supabase analytics, providing:
    *   **Project-level Analytics**: Total WE, employees per project (city).
    *   **Employee-level Analytics**: Daily status changes, status overview, hourly status changes, and a summary table with total changes, completions, average changes, total WE, WE with status (absolute & percentage).
    *   **Dashboard UI**: Clean, modern design with charts (bar, doughnut), KPIs, and tables, with custom branding.
    *   **Data Consistency**: Map employee names to email addresses, ensuring correct data flow from the Qualifizierungstool to Supabase.
    *   **Enhancements**: Export functions (PNG, CSV, PDF), advanced filters (date, project), performance optimization (SQL indices), real-time updates, mobile optimization, and enhanced user management.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main UI for the Admin Dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent extensive modifications. Initially created from scratch to display project and user analytics, it was iteratively updated to resolve display issues (e.g., zero values in tables). Later, it was significantly refactored to incorporate enhanced features like various chart types (bar, line, doughnut), comprehensive tables, dynamic filtering (project, date range), export capabilities (PNG, CSV, PDF), and a responsive design. Chart.js, date-fns, jsPDF, and html2canvas were integrated for visualization and export. Crucially, the Supabase RPC calls for analytics data were refined here. The file was provided multiple times to the user to reflect the latest working version.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The login page for the Admin Dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to handle Supabase authentication for admin users.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Introduced new Supabase functions for detailed user analytics summary.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to define  and , along with their  (admin-checked) versions. This script was heavily debugged to fix SQL syntax errors (return types), column name mismatches ( vs ), data type conflicts, and incorrect join conditions between , , and . The final version simplified joins for  to rely primarily on  directly.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains SQL for performance optimizations and advanced analytics features.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to add various PostgreSQL indices (e.g., on , ,  for analytics tables). It also defined new analytics functions like , , , , and , including their  versions and grants. This script also faced and resolved errors related to function return types.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The core UI and logic for the Qualifizierungstool (tablet app).
    -   **Changes Made**: Significantly updated to include Supabase integration for data synchronization. A new  function was added to insert status changes into the  table in Supabase, with an offline queuing mechanism for failed syncs. The  function was modified to call  upon status changes. A  function was also added to push pending offline events to Supabase.  class was added to sync contacts to/from Supabase.
-   , , :
    -   **Importance**: Core Supabase schema and initial dashboard functions.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were referenced for schema details and working join patterns during SQL debugging. Security fixes (RLS enablement,  for functions) were applied directly to functions defined in these scripts as well.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A temporary directory created to provide  and  of the Admin Dashboard for user download and manual upload to Vercel/GitHub.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains  (the full dashboard UI),  (dashboard login), and a  with upload instructions.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate deeper analytics requirements (e.g., granular activity log).
- Implement a release build workflow with keystore and signing for Play Store distribution.
- Potentially integrate a more robust Storage Access Framework (SAF) Save As dialog for Android 11+ in a separate, stable branch.
- Implement more specific time-filtered versions of analytics queries (e.g., monthly/weekly).
- Precisely define the WE (Wohnungseinheiten) logic for total_we/we_count/percentage calculations.
- Implement additional dashboard features: CSV/PNG export for charts/tables, project/user dropdown filters, persistent range selection, additional charts (weekday/hour, monthly funnel).
- Add performance indices to Supabase tables (analytics_status_events, analytics_contacts).
- Resolve the  build workflow error for the Qualifizierungstool.
- The PDF export button in the Admin Dashboard is not visible, which the user deprioritized but is an unaddressed bug.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical data synchronization issue with the Qualifizierungstool (tablet app). The user reported that status changes made on the physical tablet were not reflecting in Supabase or the Admin Dashboard, even though the preview version of the Qualifizierungstool () correctly showed these changes.

The root cause was identified: the tablet version was only storing changes locally (), while the preview version had newer code that included Supabase synchronization. To fix this, the AI engineer provided a comprehensive update to . Key changes included:

-   A new  asynchronous function to insert status changes into the  table in Supabase.
-   An offline queuing mechanism, where if Supabase sync fails, the event is stored in  () for later retry.
-   The  function was modified to call  after updating the resident's status locally.
-   A  function was added to process and upload any queued offline events when an internet connection is available.
-   The  class was introduced to handle general contact data synchronization with Supabase.
-   The application's  function was updated to load contacts from local storage, then from the cloud, and then sync any pending offline status events, with a periodic sync every 5 minutes.

After providing this updated  code for the Qualifizierungstool, the user initiated a new workflow, which resulted in an error:  produced  with . This indicates a problem in the build or testing process for the Qualifizierungstool, likely related to the location or presence of  within the  directory.
