The trajectory details an extensive and often challenging debugging process for a Capacitor/Supabase application, split into two main phases. The first phase focused on severe client-side UI issues within the Qualifizierungstool Android APK. The user reported empty pages and visible JavaScript code, which the AI initially struggled to fix, leading to regressions like rendering all sections on one page. This caused significant user frustration, culminating in the user providing a last-known-good APK (). The AI successfully used this APK to analyze the correct code structure, revert its faulty changes (primarily incorrect CSS and JavaScript navigation logic), and restore the app to a stable baseline.

The second phase shifted to the backend and the Admin Dashboard. The user reported that dashboard analytics were incorrect (e.g., showing 4 users instead of 3, aggregating data across all of a user's projects instead of filtering by the selected one). The root cause was identified: the dashboard's Supabase SQL functions were querying incomplete/outdated  tables instead of the source of truth, . The AI then undertook a complex, iterative process of rewriting numerous PL/pgSQL functions to query the  JSONB data directly. This involved fixing multiple SQL errors (syntax, type mismatches, ambiguity) and correctly implementing project-specific data filtering. The most recent work addresses lingering dashboard issues, including 404 errors for RPC calls and Invalid Date rendering in charts, indicating problems with function signatures and date formatting.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build and maintain a Qualifizierungstool as a Capacitor-based Android application for field agents to manage contacts and their statuses, with robust offline capabilities. All data must synchronize with a Supabase backend.

A key component is a web-based Admin Dashboard that provides analytics on user and project performance. Admins need to see metrics like the number of active projects, total users, and WE (Wohn-Einheiten) counts. The dashboard must allow drilling down into specific projects and users to see their individual statistics, such as status change history, completions, and performance over time.

The core requirements that have been the focus of this trajectory are:
1.  **Functional UI:** The Android app's UI must be stable, with all sections (Contacts, Import/Export, Add Address, etc.) rendering correctly as separate, functional pages.
2.  **Accurate Dashboard Analytics:** The dashboard must display correct, real-time data. This includes accurate counts of unique users and projects, and ensuring that when a project is selected, all user metrics shown are filtered specifically for that project, not aggregated across all of a user's assignments.
3.  **Data Synchronization:** Data entered in the app, such as WE-Korrekturen (unit corrections), must reliably sync to the Supabase database.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** Capacitor (for Android APK generation from a web app).
- **Frontend Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS for a single-page application (SPA) architecture.
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with extensive use of PL/pgSQL for Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
- **Data Storage:**  data type in Postgres to store the entire list of contacts and their nested residents/statuses as a single document per user.
- **Client-side Storage:**  for offline data queuing and session management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a Capacitor frontend and a Supabase backend, with a separate web dashboard.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the single HTML file that constitutes the entire client-side Android application. It contains all the HTML structure, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript logic for UI rendering, navigation (, ), data management (), and communication with Supabase.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been the subject of intense debugging. It was repeatedly broken by faulty AI edits (e.g., adding  to CSS, conflicting JS navigation scripts) which caused major UI regressions. The final stable state was achieved by completely overwriting it with the version extracted from a user-provided .

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file is the single-page application for the admin analytics dashboard. It handles fetching data from Supabase RPCs and rendering charts and KPIs.
    -   **Changes Made**: The initial file was found to be an incomplete stub. It was completely replaced with the correct version from the  directory. Subsequent edits focused on fixing the JavaScript logic to call the correct RPCs and correctly calculate metrics (e.g., counting unique users instead of summing project assignments). A  was added as a robust fix to ensure the user count remains accurate.

-   ** (e.g., , )**
    -   **Importance**: These files contain the definitions for the Supabase tables and the PL/pgSQL functions (RPCs) that power the dashboard and data synchronization.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files have been heavily modified. The core architectural change was rewriting almost all dashboard functions (e.g., , , ) to stop relying on incomplete  tables. The new versions query the  table and parse the  data directly, ensuring the dashboard reflects the true state of the application data. This involved fixing numerous SQL errors and adding project-specific filtering logic.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix WE-Korrekturen Sync**: The issue of WE-Korrekturen (unit corrections) not saving to Supabase was investigated but put on hold. The existing RPC functions need to be debugged to understand why the data isn't being processed correctly.
- **Implement Excel Export**: The user initially requested implementing export functionality for addresses and WE-corrections. This task has not been started.
- **Fix Remaining Dashboard Charts**: While some dashboard functions have been fixed, the charts for Abschlüsse (completions) and Änderungen (changes) still show incorrect (zero) values.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on fixing the Admin Dashboard UI and data rendering. The user reported that after making 3 status changes for a user (Birgit) in a new project (Saal a.d.Donau), several issues persisted:
1.  **Empty Kacheln (Tiles):** The KPI tiles for completions, changes, status breakdown, and the status table remained empty or showed 0.
2.  **Invalid Date in Charts:** The x-axis of the time-series charts displayed Invalid Date.

The AI's investigation, using screenshots of the browser's developer console provided by the user, revealed critical errors:
-   **404 Not Found Errors:** The dashboard was attempting to call Supabase RPCs (like ) that either didn't exist or had mismatched signatures (number/type of arguments), causing the network requests to fail.
-   **JavaScript State Issues:** The console showed , indicating that the dashboard's JavaScript state was not being correctly updated when a user was selected, preventing data calls from being made for that user.

The AI's last action was to provide a block of SQL code to fix the RPC  errors by creating the missing functions with corrected signatures (). It also suggested modifying the date format in the SQL functions to  to fix the Invalid Date issue. The user confirmed the  errors are gone, but the charts still show Invalid Date and the KPI tiles are still empty.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Apply the suggested SQL changes to format dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD' to fix the Invalid Date chart error and provide JavaScript snippets for the user to run in the console to debug why user data isn't loading into the dashboard's state upon selection.
